        <h3>Our Story</h3>
        <div class="divider"></div>
        <p>It all began in 2012 when we opened our first restaurant, which
          quickly became one of the most popular street-food places in Tallinn.
          Word spread across the capital and beyond and soon we were forced to
          open a bigger place to accommodate all the hungry burger friends. A
          few years later our chef Martin came up with the idea of offering mini
          burgers accompanied by a hand-selected choice of beers. Unfortunately,
          our original kitchen would have been too small to expand the concept,
          so we moved to another place in the Old Town. Our new restaurant
          has around 75 seats and offers a cozy, warm and pleasant atmosphere
          for all our guests. And as a bonus, you can get 2 hours of free
          parking as well!</p>
